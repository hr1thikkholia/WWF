Once common throughout Africa and Asia, elephant numbers were severely depleted during the<br>
 20th century, largely due to the massive ivory trade. While some populations are now stable<br>
 and growing, poaching, conflict and habitat destruction continue to threaten the species.<br><br>
 The largest land mammal on earth, the African elephant weighs up to eight tons. The elephant<br>
 is distinguished by its massive body, large ears and a long trunk, which has many uses ranging<br>
 from using it as a hand to pick up objects, as a horn to trumpet warnings, an arm raised in <br>
 greeting to a hose for drinking water or bathing.<br><br>
Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives. They are much smaller in<br>
 size and their ears are straight at the bottom, unlike the large fan-shape ears of the African<br>
 species. Only some Asian male elephants have tusks. All African elephants, including females, <br>
 have tusks. Elephants are either left or right-tusked and the one they use more is usually smaller<br>
 because of wear and tear. The Asian elephant has four toes on the hind foot and five on the forefoot,<br>
 while the African elephant has three on the hind foot and five on the forefoot.<br><br>

<img src="ele.jpg"><br><br></font><br><font color="#696969" size="4">
Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves,<br>
 while male elephants tend to live in isolation. A single calf is born to a female once every 4-5 <br>
 years and after a gestation period of 22 months—the longest of any mammal. These calves stay with <br>
 their mothers for years and are also cared for by other females in the group.<br><br>
The two species of elephants—African and Asian—need extensive land to survive. Roaming in herds and<br>
 consuming hundreds of pounds of plant matter in a single day, both species of elephant require<br>
 extensive amounts of food, water and space. As a result, these large mammals place great demands on <br>
 the environment and often come into conflict with people in competition for resources.<br><br>

<div class="padding"><font color="#DE3831" size="5"><br><br>RETALIATORY KILLINGS</font><br><br>
<font color="white" size="4">Today, the most urgent threat to elephants is large-scale poaching to supply the illegal ivory trade. Other threats facing elephants in Africa and Asia include conflict with humans and habitat loss and degradation.
WWF advocates an end to commercial elephant ivory sales in the US and other major markets like China, Thailand and Hong Kong as the most effective and efficient solution to end this illegal ivory trade.</font>
<font color="#DE3831" size="5"><br><br>ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE</font> <br>
<font color="white" size="4">In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the international trade in ivory. However, there are still some thriving but unregulated domestic ivory markets in a number of countries, which fuel an illegal international trade. Poaching to meet growing demand from affluent Asian countries is driving up the rate of poaching. In some countries, political unrest contributes to elephant poaching.

<div class="padding"><font color="black" size="5">WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES</font><br><br>
<img src="ele5.jpg" align="left"><font color="#696969" size="4">WWF understands there are extraordinary opportunities for conservation to help local people and wildlife live and prosper together. In the Eastern Himalayas, WWF works with local communities to monitor snow leopards and reduce the retaliatory killing of them through innovative local insurance plans.<br><br>
WWF also works with goat herders in Mongolia to build awareness about the plight of the snow leopard and reduce the killing of snow leopards as retaliation for killing livestock. Through the Land of Snow Project, WWF aims to secure key areas of snow leopard habitat in Mongolia.<br><br><br></font><br><br>
<font color="black" size="5">STOPPING ILLEGAL TRADE</font><br>
<img src="ele6.jpg" align="right"><font color="#696969" size="4">WWF supports mobile antipoaching activities as a way to curb the hunting of snow leopards and their prey. Together with TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, we work to eliminate the illegal trade of snow leopard fur, bones and other body parts.</font>
